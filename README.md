## General info
This project is an exercise from backend programmign in javascript

## Subject of exercise
Environment
This exercise should be solved with Node.js >= 16 and its available features. TypeScript
implementation is preferred over plain JavaScript, but no requirement.
The solution should include the full source code and any script or instruction necessary for executing/running the app. There are no restrictions regarding used libraries.

Exercise: Political Speeches
The goal of this exercise is to calculate some statistics from given input data about
political speeches. The application should handle CSV files (UTF-8 encoded), structured as below:
```
Speaker, Topic, Date, Words
Alexander Abel, Education Policy, 2012-10-30, 5310 
Bernhard Belling, Coal Subsidies, 2012-11-05, 1210 
Caesare Collins, Coal Subsidies, 2012-11-06, 1119 
Alexander Abel, Internal Security, 2012-12-11, 911
```
The application should provide an HTTP endpoint which accepts one or more given URLs (http and https) via query parameters at the path:
GET /evaluation?url=url1&url=url2

The provided CSV files at these URLs should be downloaded, processed and evaluated to answer the following questions:
1. Which politician gave the most speeches in 2013?
2. Which politician gave the most speeches on the topic â€žInternal Security"?
3. Which politician used the fewest words (in total)?

The answers should be provided as JSON. If a question cannot be answered or does not
have an unambiguous solution the result for this field should be null.

As an example, for the given input above the expected result is:
```
{
"mostSpeeches": null,
"mostSecurity": "Alexander Abel",
"leastWordy": "Caesare Collins"
}
```
